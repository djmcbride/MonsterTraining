# MonsterTraining
Something of a coding playground in which I will get to grips with C#'s basic concepts. This project will see me create a simple, text based game in which I can train and battle monsters. 

My aim is going to be to nurture this little testbed into a more and more viable product until I can eventually make it comply with UWP standards, complete with GUI and deploy it to my phone & PC...  Yes... I have a Windows Phone...

The main point here is that I can have fun while consolidating all of the things I'm learning in the Pluralsight C# Path.  Once I have a little more confidence, I'll start work on a couple of other projects that I'd like to get through this summer.
